ğŸš€ Exciting Project Update: Zerodha !
Hey everyone! Iâ€™m thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve developed a Zerodha, inspired by Zerodha, a leading discount brokerage firm in India. This project was an incredible journey, and hereâ€™s a breakdown of what I built and learned:
Tech Stack
Frontend:
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
Backend:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
Database:
* MongoDB
What I Learned
* UI Design with React: Crafted the user interface to be intuitive and responsive.
* Data Visualization with Chart.js: Implemented dynamic charts to display data effectively.
* Unit Testing with Jest: Ensured code reliability and functionality through rigorous testing.
This project has not only enhanced my skills in web development but also deepened my understanding of building full-stack applications. Iâ€™m excited about the potential of this application and look forward to your feedback and suggestions!
